A __*simple*__ music player app made in Flutter

## Current features

- List all mp3 files from Download directory
- Ignore all file with song duration below 30s (configurable)
- List all artists (artists named by user, default 'Unknown')
- Listen to song
- Sort songs by: name, most played, add time (persistent data)
- Download music from YouTube and SoundCloud using URL (has some limitations)
- Change song info
- Player screen (seek, play/pause, minimize)
- Controls from lock screen & notification
- Playlist (created from selected song scope)
- Prev/next song
- Play mode (repeat all, shuffle, repeat one)
- Search songs
- User settings
- User created albums
- Modifiable song order in playlist

## Planned features

- ~~Set volume for individual song (not system/device volume)~~ Seems a bit too difficult (MPEG 2.5 Layer 3) for such a unimportant feature
